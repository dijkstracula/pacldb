# PDCL tutorial

This document contains an overview for editors and administrators of the
Pan-Dene Comparative Lexicon.

Editing the Lexicon requires an active account.  There are two different
account types, with different levels of permissions on the site:

- An administrator account has permission to create new Lexicon entries
as well as edit any existing entry.  An administrator may also invite
new users to the Lexicon, manage existing users, and change static content
(such as this document).  Administrators should read this entire document.

- A guest editor account has permission to create new Lexicon entries,
and edit entries that they have created themselves.  Guest editors should
read the "Editing the Lexicon" portion of this document.

## Editing the lexicon

A logged-in guest or administrator will see two differences in the 
[browse](/browse) page:

- A green "new" button that creates a new entry;
- Another column labeled "admin", with buttons to edit or delete entries.
